There's a search tag calledd 'hipster', whish will give you the results of the 10% least popular songs. \r\nVery nice play on words! \r\n\r\nThis app is not greatly organized, I just wanted to understand how to create components in react.\r\nAditionally, I went a little overboard with styling the css and making it look nice :)\r\n\r\nTake a look, to run it just type `npm install` in the root folder, then `npm start`.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Becuse I'm a noob, I included the webpack entry in index.jade, as a script. To run it on your computer, remove this line: `script(src='http://io.jose-canahui.com:8090/js/app.js', defer)`\r\nThat way the app will look for your `app.js` file and not mine :)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
