# spotify-hipster
A Search feature for Spotify that provides the most unpopular(hipster) results.

My first try at ReactJs, demo app available : http://spotify.canahui.me

I love spotify, and was browsing its api. There's a search tag calledd 'hipster', whish will give you the results of the 10% least popular songs.
Very nice play on words!

This app is not greatly organized, I just wanted to understand how to create components in react.
Aditionally, I went a little overboard with styling the css and making it look nice :)

Take a look, to run it just type `npm install` in the root folder, then `npm start`.

NOTE: Becuse I'm a noob, I included the webpack entry in index.jade, as a script. To run it on your computer, remove this line: `script(src='http://io.jose-canahui.com:8090/js/app.js', defer)`
That way the app will look for your `app.js` file and not mine :)
