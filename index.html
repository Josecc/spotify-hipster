<p>A Search feature for Spotify that provides the most unpopular (hipster) results.</p>

<p>My first try at ReactJs, demo app available <a href="http://io.jose-canahui.com:3000">here</a></p>

<p>I love spotify, and was browsing its api. There's a search tag calledd 'hipster', whish will give you the results of the 10% least popular songs. 
Very nice play on words! </p>

<p>This app is not greatly organized, I just wanted to understand how to create components in react.
Aditionally, I went a little overboard with styling the css and making it look nice :)</p>

<p>Take a look, to run it just type <code>npm install</code> in the root folder, then <code>npm start</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Becuse I'm a noob, I included the webpack entry in index.jade, as a script. To run it on your computer, remove this line: <code>script(src='http://io.jose-canahui.com:8090/js/app.js', defer)</code>
That way the app will look for your <code>app.js</code> file and not mine :)</p>
